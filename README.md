# OpenDateRange
This is a Python package that provides date ranges which allow open borders.
Thereby it is possible to create date ranges that contain all dates 
up to a certain date or all dates from a certain date. Of course date ranges 
with concrete dates as borders are supported as well. But there is no support
for any kind of daytime measurement. 

## Technical information
The package was developed with python 2.7.18 and only uses the build in 
python packages abc and datetime.
